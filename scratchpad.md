- R-squared - 0.532, which means a little more than half of the observed variation in price can be explained by the model's inputs
- All p-values in the model are lower than a 0.05 threshold. With the null hypothesis being that any particular characteristic of a house has no effect on the house's price, we can reject that hypothesis for these features. In other words, there is a less than 5% chance (much less for this model's features),  that the included features do not have an effect on the price. 
- Houses in an active market have higher prices
